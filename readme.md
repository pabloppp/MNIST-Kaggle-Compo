## MNIST Kaggle Compo

I recently finished the first module of the Deep Learning Coursera course by Andrew Ng [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
so I tried to apply all that I learned to improve my previous results.

I will keep improving this repo while I learn new things in the 2nd module, hopefully one day I'll be in the top 100 from the competiton :P
